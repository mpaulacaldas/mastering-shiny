# Shiny modules {#action-modules}

```{r, include = FALSE}
source("common.R")
```

As your Shiny app grows you will find it increasingly hard to understand how all the pieces fit together. Or you might find yourself in a situation where fixing one thing breaks something else, meaning that adding any new feature feels like it's much harder than it should be. Or you might find yourself spending forever scrolling up and down a veeeeeeery long `app.R` looking for the UI component you're thinking of. All these are signs that it's time to break your app up into smaller independent pieces, or **modules**. 

A module is just a pair of functions (one for UI and one for server), but give you the benefit of **namespacing**. So far, when writing an app, all IDs (the "names" of the controls) are global; all parts of your server function see all parts of your UI. This is like only using global variables in a R script. Modules give you the ability to create local IDs that can only be seen within the module. This property is called namespacing because it creates "spaces" of "names" that are isolate from the rest of the world.

Modules give your Shiny similar benefits to using functions in regular R code. Imagine if you all variables in R were global[^S]. It would be very difficult to write a function because you might accidentally clobber a variable that the user had defined. 

[^S]: If you ever used S, the precursor to R, you don't need to imagine because this is how S worked!

When this happens to you, it's a good time to consider using Shiny modules. Shiny modules require a learning a couple of new ideas (particularly namespacing), but have a big payoff because they enable you to write much more ambitious apps because they support greater isolation and easier reuse:

*   Modules isolate subcomponents of your app so that they can only communicate
    is specified ways. This makes it easier to understand how your app works 
    because you can write, analyse, and test individual components by 
    themselves. Modules also provide a standard way of spreading your app 
    across multiple files.
    
*   Modules support reuse of client-side HTML and server-side behaviour by
    wrapping repeated code into functions that can be called in multiple
    places in your app.

These benefits might sound familiar because they're very similar to the benefits that functions bring to your R code. And that's not a surprise because modules are just functions with a specific structure. This means anything you can do with a function, you can do with a module.

```{r setup}
library(shiny)

# This is a new style of module construction that will appear in shiny 1.5.0.
# For now, we're adding a simple shim that you can use on your own, and delete
# when shiny 1.5.0 is out.
moduleServer <- function(id, module) {
  callModule(module, id)
}
```

## Big picture {#module-motivation}

Before we dive into the details of how to create your own modules, it's useful to get more of a sense for exactly how they change the "shape" of your app. I'm going to borrow an example from [Eric Nantz](https://github.com/rpodcast), who talked about modules at rstudio::conf(2019): <https://youtu.be/ylLLVo2VL50>. Eric was motivated to use module because he had a big complex app, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:modules-before). Obviously, you don't know anything about the specifics of this app, but you can get some sense of the complexity.

```{r modules-before, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL, fig.cap="A rough sketch of a complex app. I've done my best to display it simply in a diagram, but it's still hard to understand what all the pieces are"}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/action-modules/before.png", dpi = 300)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:modules-after) shows the sketch of the app design after converting to modules.

* They app is divided up into pieces, and each piece has a name that we can
  refer. Naming the pieces means that the names of the controls can be simpler.

* A module is a black box with defined inputs and outputs. Like a function,
  you can't reach inside a module and read from its inputs or write to its
  outputs.

* Modules are reusable so we can write one function generates both yellow 
  and both blue components.

```{r modules-after, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL, fig.cap="After converting the app to use modules, it's much easier to see key parts of the app, and see what is re-used in multiple places (the blue and yellow components)."}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/action-modules/after.png", dpi = 300)
```

Once you've master the basic technology of modules, there's still a lot of learn. Often the hardest part is figuring out the best way to decompose your big problem into smaller independent pieces. I include some case studies here to help you get a sense of how this feels, but ultimately it's a skill that can only be learned with practice. Try and set aside some time each week where you're not improving the behaviour or appearance of your app, but simply making it easier to understand. This will make your app easier to change in the future, and as you practice these skills your first attempt will become higher quality.

## Module basics

A module is very similar to an app. Like an app, it's composed of two pieces:

* A function that generates to the `ui` specification. (Unlike an app, module 
  `ui` is always a function.)

* A function that runs code inside the `server` function.

The functions have standard forms. They both take an `id` argument and use it to namespace the module. The namespace is the defining feature of modules: it guarantees their isolation and allows you to use one module in multiple places in the same app.

Let's take a very simple app and turn it into a module. This app is so simple that there's no real benefit to modularising it, but it will serve to illustrate the basic process before we dive into more realistic, and hence complicated, use cases. The app draws a plot of a histogram for a user selected variable and number of bins.

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  selectInput("var", "Variable", names(mtcars)),
  numericInput("bins", "bins", 10, min = 1),
  plotOutput("hist")
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  data <- reactive(mtcars[[input$var]])
  output$hist <- renderPlot({
    hist(data(), breaks = input$bins, main = input$var)
  })
}
```

### Module UI

To turn this into a module we need to turn the UI and server components into module UI and module server functions. We'll start with the UI. There are two steps:

* We put the UI code inside a function. The function must take an `id` argument.

* Each existing ID needs to be wrapped in a call to `NS()`, so that (e.g.)
  `"var"` becomes `NS(id, "var")`. 

The key idea that makes modules work is that the ID of each component is now determined by two pieces: one piece is supplied by the user of the module, and the other is supplied by the author of the module. This two-part creation means that you as a module author don't need to worry about clashing with other UI components created by the user. You have your own "space" of names that you control.

Making the changes above yields the following function:

```{r}
histogramUI <- function(id) {
  list(
    selectInput(NS(id, "var"), "Variable", names(mtcars)),
    numericInput(NS(id, "bins"), "bins", 10, min = 1),
    plotOutput(NS(id, "hist"))
  )
}
```

Note that here we return the UI components in a list; that means they will get included in the parent container when added to the final UI. Returning a list is most flexible because it allows the caller of the module to put it in whatever container they want. But if in your app, you always place the module in the same container you might want to include that in the UI function and instead return a `column()` or a `fluidRow()`.

(If you're using dynamic UI, you need one extra little trick - you can get the current namespace through `session$ns`; and you don't need to explicitly pass the `id`.)

### Module server

Next we tackle the server function. This gets wrapped inside _another_ function which must have an `id` argument. This function calls `moduleServer()` with the `id`, and a function that looks like a regular server function:

```{r}
histogramServer <- function(id) {
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, server) {
    data <- reactive(mtcars[[input$var]])
    output$hist <- renderPlot({
      hist(data(), breaks = input$bins, main = input$var)
    })
  })
}
```

Unlike the `ui` function, you only need to use `id` in one place: in the call to `moduleServer()`. Shiny automatically namespaces `input` or `output` so that your module code can only access elements with the matching `id`. If you want to take input from reactives elsewhere in the app, you'll need to pass them to the module function explicitly; we'll come back to that later.

### Updated app

Now that we have the ui and server functions, it's good practice to write a function that uses them to generate an app, which we can use for testing. Here the function isn't strictly needed because it doesn't have any arguments, but it's good practice that will server you well as your modules get more complicated. More complicated modules are likely also like to require additional inputs or outputs.

```{r}
histogramModule <- function() {
  ui <- fluidPage(
    histogramUI("hist1")
  )
  server <- function(input, output, session) {
    histogramServer("hist1")
  }
  shinyApp(ui)  
}
```

Note that, just like regular inputs/output and reactives the UI and server are linked by a shared ID. Otherwise they're black boxes and you can't see inside them: you can't see any inputs, outputs, or reactives inside the module.

### Naming scheme

Note that we've used a consistent naming scheme for all the components of our module. I think this is good practice because it makes it obvious that the pieces are connected, and makes it easier for other people reading your code to recognise that you're using a module.

Since the modules is about histograms, I've called it the `histogram` module. This then leads to:

* `R/histogram.R` holds all the code for the module. If you're using Shiny
  1.5.0 or greater, these will be automatically loaded; otherwise you'll 
  need to include a call to `source()` in your `app.R`.

* `histogramUI()` generates the UI. If it provided solely input or output 
   controls I'd call it `histogramInput()` or `histogramOuput()` respectively.

* `histogramServer()` generates the server function.

* `histogramModule()` creates a complete app for testing.

## Inputs and outputs

Now that we have a simple module under our belt we can start creating some more useful examples. Sometimes a module with no additional ui or server argument is useful because it allows you to pull out complex code into its own file so you don't have to worry about it interactive with the rest of the app. But usually your modules will have inputs and outputs that allow it to coordinate with other components of your app. Unlike the usual freedom of association inside the server function, modules enforce specific lines of communication. This makes constructing your app a little harder but it makes understanding it much much simpler.

(You might see advice on-line to use `session$userData`. I think this is generally bad advice because it takes an end run around namespacing and re-introduces many of the problems that you're trying to avoid by using modules. )

### UI inputs

Adding arguments to your UI function allows the user greater control over its apperance, often allowing you to use the same module in multiple place in the app. Remember, the module UI is just a regular R function, so you are mostly constrained by your function writing skills. If you're newer to writing functions, start by writing functions that extract out existing repeated patterns in your code. As you get more experience, you can begin to anticipate future needs.

### Server inputs

Module server functions can take two types of inputs:

* Static setup inputs. These values are used to initialise the server and do 
  not change.

* Reactive inputs, which allow your module to respond to changes initialised
  by the user. 
  
Most inputs will be reactive, so if you're not sure, you should err on the side of making it a reactive.

Because you will get cryptic error messages if you pass an reactive instead of a constant or a constant instead of a reactive, I strongly recommend adding some basic assertions to the top of your module server. Something like this only takes a minute or so to write, but will save you a long of potential future frustration from using your module incorrectly.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stopifnot(is.reactive(arg1))
stopifnot(!is.reactive(arg2))
```

Note that you should never pass an input directly to an module server. If for example, you pass `input$foo`, it will pass the value of `input$foo` when the app starts, i.e. the initial `value` you set in the control. Instead, you'll need to wrap it in `reactive()` so that it continues to update.

```{r}
multiplierUI <- function(id) {
  list(
    numericInput(NS(id, "x"), NULL, 1),
    " * ",
    textOutput(NS(id, "y"), inline = TRUE),
    " = ",
    textOutput(NS(id, "result"), inline = TRUE)
  )
}

multiplierServer <- function(id, y) {
  stopifnot(is.reactive(y))
  
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
    output$y <- renderText(y())
    output$result <- renderText(input$x * y())
  })
}
```


```{r}
multiplierModule <- function() {
  ui <- fluidPage(
    numericInput("y", "y", value = 10),
    multiplierUI("mult")
  )
  
  server <- function(input, output, session) {
    multiplierServer("mult", reactive(input$y))
  }
  
  shinyApp(ui, server)
}
multiplierModule()
```


Roxygen documentation conventions are worthwhile even if you don't use roxygen2. Add `@param` and `@returns` arguments to describe exactly how the server component of the module works.





### Server outputs


How to return multiple values? Return a list of reactives.

### Case study: summary

```{r}
selectNumericVarInput <- function(id) {
  selectInput(NS(id, "var"), "Variable", choices = NULL) 
}

selectNumericVarServer <- function(id, df) {
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
    observeEvent(df(), {
      is_numeric <- vapply(df(), is.numeric, logical(1))
      updateSelectInput(session, "var", choices = names(df())[is_numeric])
    })
    
    reactive(df()[[input$var]])
  })
}

summaryOuput <- function(id) {
  tags$ul(
    tags$li("Min: ", textOutput(NS(id, "min"), inline = TRUE)),
    tags$li("Max: ", textOutput(NS(id, "max"), inline = TRUE)),
    tags$li("Missing: ", textOutput(NS(id, "n_na"), inline = TRUE))
  )
}

summaryServer <- function(id, var) {
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
    rng <- reactive({
      req(var())
      range(var(), na.rm = TRUE)
    })
    
    output$min <- renderText(rng()[[1]])
    output$max <- renderText(rng()[[2]])
    output$n_na <- renderText(sum(is.na(var())))
  })
}

ui <- fluidPage(
  selectInput("dfname", "Data frame", choices = c("iris", "mtcars")),
  selectNumericVarInput("var"),
  summaryOuput("summary")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  df <- reactive(switch(input$dfname, 
    mtcars = mtcars,
    iris = iris
  ))
  # Testing
  var <- selectNumericVarServer("var", df)
  summaryServer("summary", var)
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```



## Reusable components

### Date with error

To convert the code above into a module, we need to make two changes. First we need to add an `id` argument to our UI component, and use it with special `NS()` function. `NS` is short for namespace: it creates a "space" of "names" that is unique to the module. 

First we create the UI. I use the `Input` suffix because from the outside this is about creating an different way of inputing dates; the output is just an implementation detail.

```{r}
ymdDateInput <- function(id, label) {
  label <- paste0(label, " (yyyy-mm-dd)")
  
  fluidRow(
    textInput(NS(id, "date"), label),
    textOutput(NS(id, "error"))
  )
}
```


```{r}
ymdDateServer <- function(id) {
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
    date <- reactive({
      req(input$date)
      ymd(input$date, quiet = TRUE)
    })
    
    output$error <- renderText({
      if (is.na(date())) {
        "Please enter valid date in yyyy-mm-dd form"
      }
    })
  
    date
  })
}
```

Now the arguments to `ymdInput()` have changed: we pass in the `id`, and Shiny takes care of automatically plumbing up the input, output, and session in the appropriate namespaced way. That why I've removed the `Server` from the name - since the details are hidden from the interface.

```{r}
ymdDateModule <- function(label) {
  ui <- fluidPage(
    ymdDateInput("ymd", label),
    textOutput("date")
  )
  server <- function(input, output, session) {
    date <- ymdDateServer("ymd")
    output$date <- renderText(date)
  }
}

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  birthday <- ymdDate("birthday")
  
  age <- reactive({
    req(birthday())
    (birthday() %--% today()) %/% years(1)
  })
  
  output$age <- renderText({
    paste0("You are ", age(), " years old")
  })
}
```

To help cement the ideas of modules in your head, the following case studies use module to develop a few simple reusable components.

### Limited selection + other

<div class="answer">
Cool way to mix `radioButtons()` with `selectInput()`.
</div>

Consider the following app, which provides a way to select gender that is sensitive to the many possible ways that people can express their gender.[^gender]

[^gender]: For a deeper dive on this issue, and a discussion of why many commonly used way of asking about gender can be hurtful to some people, I recommend reading "Designing forms for gender diversity and inclusion" by Sabrina Fonseca: <https://uxdesign.cc/d8194cf1f51>.

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  radioButtons("gender", "Gender:",
    choiceValues = list("male", "female", "self-described", "na"),
    choiceNames = list(
      "Male",
      "Female",
      textInput("gender_self", NULL, placeholder = "Self-described"),
      "Prefer not to say"
    ),
    selected = "na",
  ),
  textOutput("txt")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observeEvent(input$gender_self, {
    req(input$gender_self)
    updateRadioButtons(session, "gender", selected = "self-described")
  })
  
  gender <- reactive({
    if (input$gender == "self-described") {
      input$gender_self
    } else {
      input$gender
    }
  })
  
  output$txt <- renderText({
    paste("You chose", gender())
  })
}
```

Convert to a module and generalise a little.

<div class="answer">
`r emo::ji("exploding_head")` `unname()`. So useful.

`r emo::ji("warning")` We need to wrap `textInput()` with `list()`. Otherwise, we get the following error:

```r
#> Error in normalizeChoicesArgs(choices, choiceNames, choiceValues) : 
#>  `choiceNames` and `choiceValues` must have the same length.
```

`r emo::ji("bug")` In the app with the module, it is imposible to change to another option after writing something out in the `textInput()`. This was not an issue in the previous app. Keep an eye out for <https://github.com/hadley/mastering-shiny/pull/138>.

</div>

```{r}
radioButtonsExtraUI <- function(id, label, choices, selected = NULL, placeholder = NULL) {
  ns <- NS(id)
  
  radioButtons(ns("primary"), "Gender:",
    choiceValues = c(names(choices), "other"),
    choiceNames = c(
      unname(choices),
      list(textInput(ns("other"), NULL, placeholder = NULL))
    ),
    selected = selected
  )
}

radioButtonsExtraServer <- function(id) {
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, server) {
    observeEvent(input$primary, {
      req(input$other)
      updateRadioButtons(session, "primary", selected = "other")
    })
    
    reactive({
      if (input$primary == "other") {
        input$other
      } else {
        input$primary
      }
    })
  })
}

ui <- fluidPage(
  radioButtonsExtraUI("gender", 
    label = "Gender", 
    choices = list(
      male = "Male",
      female = "Female",
      na = "Prefer not to say"
    ), 
    placeholder = "Self-described", 
    selected = "na"
  ),
  textOutput("txt")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  gender <- radioButtonsExtraServer("gender")

  output$txt <- renderText({
    paste("You chose", gender())
  })
}
```

### Wizard

* Buttons go in container not individual pages.
* Figure out some hack to disable prev button on first page.
* Note that don't need to worry about namespacing UI supplied by module user.

## Single object modules

When many people encounter modules for the first time, they immediately attempt to rewrite into a single "thing", a module object that has both UI and server components. If that didn't occur to you, feel free to skip this last part of the chapter, because it explains why that approach (which occurs to many people) isn't a good fit for Shiny.

Shiny explicitly considered and rejected this design because it has some major limitations. For this to work, you have to define the module outside of the server and the UI. That means there's no way to make any of the inputs to the module reactive. 

In Shiny, UI and server are inherently disconnected; Shiny doesn't know which UI invocation belongs to which server session. You can see this pattern throughout Shiny: for example, `plotOutput()` and `renderPlot()` are connected only by shared ID. Writing modules as separate functions reflects that reality: they're distinct functions that are not connected other than through a shared ID.

To illustrate the problem, lets generalise the motivating example from the first part of the chapter so that the data frame is now a parameter:

```{r}
histogramUI <- function(id, df) {
  list(
    selectInput(NS(id, "var"), "Variable", names(df)),
    numericInput(NS(id, "bins"), "bins", 10, min = 1),
    plotOutput(NS(id, "hist"))
  )
}

histogramServer <- function(id, df) {
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
    data <- reactive(df[[input$var]])
    output$hist <- renderPlot({
      hist(data(), breaks = input$bins, main = input$var)
    })
  })
}
```

And that leads to the following app:

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  tabsetPanel(
    tabPanel("mtcars", histogramUI("mtcars", mtcars)),
    tabPanel("iris", histogramUI("iris", iris))
  )
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  histogramServer("mtcars", mtcars)
  histogramServer("iris", iris)
}
```

It seems undesirable that we have to repeat both the ID and the name of the dataset in both the UI and server, so it's natural to want to wrap into a single function that returns both the UI and the server:

```{r}
histogramModule <- function(id, df) {
  list(
    ui = histogramUI(id, df), 
    server = histogramServer(id, df)
  )
}
```

Then we define the module outside of the UI and server, extracting elements from the list as needed:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
hist1 <- histogramModule("mtcars", mtcars)
hist2 <- histogramModule("iris", iris)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tabsetPanel(
    tabPanel("mtcars", hist1$ui()),
    tabPanel("iris", hist2$ui())
  )
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  hist1$server()
  hist2$server()
}
```

There are two problems with this code. Firstly, it doesn't work, because `moduleFunction()` must be called inside a server function. But imagine that problem didn't exist or you worked around it some other way. There's still a big problem: what if we want to allow the user to select the dataset, i.e. we want to make the `df` argument reactive. That can't work because the module is instantiated before the server function, i.e. before we know that information. 

This is fundamentally the way that Shiny works: UI controls and server code are fundamentally de-coupled and only communicated through a shared ID. 

If you find your fingers itching to make a single module object that incorporates both UI and server components it's almost certainly a sign that you've decomposed your repeated code into a module in a suboptimal way.

## Exercises

1. The following app plots user selected variables from the `msleep` dataset 
   for three different types of mammals (carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores), 
   with one tab for each type of mammal. Remove the redundancy in the 
   `selectInput()` definitions with the use of functions.
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    
    ui <- fluidPage(
      selectInput(inputId = "x",
                  label = "X-axis:",
                  choices = c("sleep_total", "sleep_rem", "sleep_cycle", 
                              "awake", "brainwt", "bodywt"),
                  selected = "sleep_rem"),
      selectInput(inputId = "y",
                  label = "Y-axis:",
                  choices = c("sleep_total", "sleep_rem", "sleep_cycle", 
                              "awake", "brainwt", "bodywt"),
                  selected = "sleep_total"),

                  tabPanel("Herbivore",
                           plotOutput("plot_herbi")))
    )
    
    server <- function(input, output, session) {
    
      # make subsets
      carni <- reactive( filter(msleep, vore == "carni") )
      omni  <- reactive( filter(msleep, vore == "omni")  )
      herbi <- reactive( filter(msleep, vore == "herbi") )
    
      # make plots

          geom_point()
      })
      output$plot_omni <- renderPlot({

          geom_point()
      })

          geom_point()
      })
    
    }
    
    shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

2. Continue working with the same app from the previous exercise, and further 
   remove redundancy in the code by modularizing how subsets and plots are 
   created.
   
   <div class="answer">
   I can't figure out how to do it with a module. Here is an approach that works, with the disadvantage that it is not associated with the UI code.
   
    ```{r}
    server <- function(input, output, session) {
    
      createGgplotVore <- function(myvore, input_x = input$x, input_y = input$y) {
        
        output_name <- paste0("plot_", myvore)
        
        output[[output_name]] <- renderPlot({
          vore_df <- filter(msleep, vore == myvore)
          ggplot(data = vore_df, aes_string(x = input_x, y = input_y)) +
            geom_point()
        })
        
      }
      
      createGgplotVore("carni")
      createGgplotVore("omni")
      createGgplotVore("herbi")
    
    }
    ```
   
   </div>
   
3. Suppose you have an app that is slow to launch when a user visits it. Can  
   modularizing your app code help solve this problem? Explain your reasoning.
